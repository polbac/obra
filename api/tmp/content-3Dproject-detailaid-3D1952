Water elements \u201cindent\u201d the building, which steps from the roof to the courtyards in a series of garden terraces that also bring light and air into the building. The two top floors of the children\u2019s classrooms form a protected recess space where the children can survey the city\u2019s horizon and its continuing development.\u00a0A school\u2019s multifarious nature prompts varied space and function arrangements. The building links to the surrounding city by tentacle-like elements that almost disengage the rest of the building to approach the city. Each element pursues the unique architectural possibilities of its program, but all elements are still linked by didactic purpose and design.","post_title":"<p>IGS Hannover Public School, M&uuml;hlenberg, DE 2010<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"igs-hannover-public-school-mhlenberg-de-2010","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-05-17 19:50:28","post_modified_gmt":"2017-05-17 19:50:28","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/obra.neptuno.digital\/?post_type=projects&#038;p=1952","menu_order":0,"post_type":"projects","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","ancestors":[],"page_template":"","post_category":[],"tags_input":[],"extended":{"year":"","images":[{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_02.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_02-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_02-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_02-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_02-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_02-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"18","credit":"","camera":"Canon EOS 30D","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1277837171","copyright":"","focal_length":"44","iso":"400","shutter_speed":"1","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""},{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_01.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_01-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_01-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_01-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_01-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_01-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"11","credit":"","camera":"Canon EOS 30D","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1277822810","copyright":"","focal_length":"20","iso":"400","shutter_speed":"0.5","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""}],"images_final":[{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_02.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_02-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_02-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_02-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_02-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_02-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"18","credit":"","camera":"Canon EOS 30D","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1277837171","copyright":"","focal_length":"44","iso":"400","shutter_speed":"1","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""},{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_01.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_01-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_01-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_01-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_01-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_IGS_HANNOVER_SCHOOL_01-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"11","credit":"","camera":"Canon EOS 30D","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1277822810","copyright":"","focal_length":"20","iso":"400","shutter_speed":"0.5","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""}]}}}
