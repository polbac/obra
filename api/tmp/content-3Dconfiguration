This invariable of Obra\u2019s work, the constant presence of an implicit city, inhabits the typological mutations that propel forward their disciplinary project. \u201cOblivious\" to location, this civic longing runs through every proposal like a high-voltage current propelled by the nostalgia of architecture. In the face of the spectacle of the city dissolving into procedural regulations and an administrative \u201ccommon\" sense, Obra\u2019s work quietly proposes an experiment: trying to weave the built world, our \"artificial fatherland\" with the two basic strains of inhabited space: one born out of a craving for community and the other born out of a love for solitude\u2014the two poles across which spans architecture as the scene of our emotional longing."}}}
