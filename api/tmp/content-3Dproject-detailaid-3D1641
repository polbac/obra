Inside this twenty-foot-deep gap run the north-south Amtrak trains entering in and exiting out of Penn Station. Our project proposes not so much to fill the gap but rather to bridge it, thus occupying it without erasing it. The height of the three buildings is the same dimension as the horizontal length of gap, a correspondence which ties together the new and the existing, creating an implied virtual square in the skyline. To the south, the building is outfitted with continuous steel louvers, allowing sun exposure in the interior during the winter and shade during the summer. Here\u00a0the building also presents to the street a public space that could be occupied by the community or some business. This space is developed as a semi-detached structure that breaks down the scale of the tower to the pedestrian. The roof of the piano community space is developed as a mound playground for the children while the entry to the building is topped by a cubical structure containing a co-op board meeting room, symbolically representing a gatehouse (since co-op boards in New York City are notorious for keeping worthy people in need of housing out of the buildings they oversee unless they are employed by a Wall Street investment bank).","post_title":"<p>Twisted Tower, New York, US
