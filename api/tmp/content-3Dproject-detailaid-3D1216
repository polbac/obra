The building is envisioned as gates to the park on its north side. Up to now, the park simply ends in front of city buildings. Designed in regulated harmonies of the Golden Section and cubical spaces, the building will, from the bottom of the park, give noble focus to the view uphill. When entering from the north, the building will mark the beginning of the park and offer itself as majestic entrance. With its quiet brick expression, deep shadows in the gates and unruly roof vegetation amongst the park trees, the building may seem to some a natural presence in the park, perhaps reminiscent of a landscape by Claude Lorrain or Francesco Guardi. By creating both a day care building and gates to the park, the project is transformed into a hybrid of a building in the city and urban infrastructure, legitimizing this way its presence in the park.","post_title":"<p>Daycare, St. Gallen, CH 2015<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"daycare-st-gallen-ch-2015","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-05-16 19:31:33","post_modified_gmt":"2017-05-16 19:31:33","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/obra.neptuno.digital\/?post_type=projects&#038;p=1216","menu_order":0,"post_type":"projects","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","ancestors":[],"page_template":"","post_category":[],"tags_input":[],"extended":{"year":"","images":[{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_01.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_01-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_01-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_01-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_01-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_01-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"10","credit":"","camera":"NIKON D7100","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1425081600","copyright":"","focal_length":"55","iso":"100","shutter_speed":"0.05","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""},{"image":{"width":2500,"height":1545,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_02.png","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_02-760x460.png","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_02-300x185.png","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_02-768x475.png","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_02-1500x927.png","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_02-1200x742.png","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/png"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""}],"images_final":[{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_01.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_01-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_01-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_01-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_01-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_01-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"10","credit":"","camera":"NIKON D7100","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1425081600","copyright":"","focal_length":"55","iso":"100","shutter_speed":"0.05","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""},{"image":{"width":2500,"height":1545,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_02.png","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_02-760x460.png","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_02-300x185.png","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_02-768x475.png","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_02-1500x927.png","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_DAYCARE_GALLEN_02-1200x742.png","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/png"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""}]}}}
