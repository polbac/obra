{"detail":{"ID":2161,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-01-09 17:36:29","post_date_gmt":"2018-01-09 17:36:29","post_content":"We see architecture embarking on a worthy quest for\u00a0anonymity, one that perhaps counter-intuitively, will\u00a0lead the discipline back to envisioning the city as a\u00a0\u201ccollective work of art\u201d. The anonymity we imagine\u00a0here is predicated upon regular rhythms, a stubborn\u00a0insistence on repetitive and simple forms, and on the\u00a0serene boredom produced by relentlessly recurring\u00a0dimensions. Today for the most part, architectural\u00a0form is put to the sorry task of buttressing a world\u00a0epidemic of egocentric individualism. We don\u2019t\u00a0know why that is. Maybe it is just the logical form\u00a0taken by the advanced stages of the social and\u00a0economic system we live under. To escape\u00a0from the architectural imagination as the\u00a0instrument of selfish reasoning, we must\u00a0engage with an alternative form of\u00a0architectural \u201cbeauty\u201d. If \u201cinteresting\u201d\u00a0form is associated with individualism\u00a0and a snobbish understanding of\u00a0\u201cquality\u201d, then the tedious and the\u00a0apparently uninteresting present\u00a0themselves as a viable alternative to\u00a0salvage architecture as a cultural\u00a0form. By engaging with this strange\u00a0form that is a kind of \u201cnegative\u00a0dialectic\u201d or an expression of the\u00a0expressionless, perhaps \u201chumanity\u201d can\u00a0still reflect on its prospects without naivet\u00e9\u00a0or hypocrisy. Three pairs of five-meter tall\u00a0walls separated approximately 5.5 meters from\u00a0each other define a hexagonal space. From each\u00a0of the walls, a slide presentation of architectural\u00a0works is projected onto its opposite wall within the\u00a0space. Aiming straight at each other across the interior,\u00a0the projectors display images of nine 30cm by 60cm\u00a0frames or a 3x3 grid. The nine frames visible on any of\u00a0the walls at any given point make up one larger image\u00a0as though it were the view of a landscape perceived\u00a0from a nine-pane window or the embodiment of a\u00a0gridded image, where a basic Cartesian logic was\u00a0imposed on the given as the only hope for the layers\u00a0of diversity to approach some kind of consensus.","post_title":"<p>Indifferent
