The building has ten floors, and with a relatively small footprint\u2014approximately 144 square meters which diminish with every floor to allow for the wide terraces\u2014it assumes the form of a mini-tower and demands an architectural resolution at the top. The top space is designated as \u201cplaza,\u201d a shared void, colonnaded in its perimeter but open to the sky.\u00a0The terraces face alternately to the north and east, in the interior only one apartment is allowed to open onto any one terrace defining a matrix of complex domestic spaces organized into one and two level apartments and minimizing corridors.","post_title":"<p>Sphinx, San Juan, AR 2016<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"sphinx-san-juan-ar-2016","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-06-05 19:19:29","post_modified_gmt":"2017-06-05 19:19:29","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/obra.neptuno.digital\/?post_type=projects&#038;p=1482","menu_order":0,"post_type":"projects","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","ancestors":[],"page_template":"","post_category":[],"tags_input":[],"extended":{"year":"","images":[{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_SPHINX_01.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_01-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_01-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_01-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_01-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_01-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""},{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_SPHINX_02.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_02-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_02-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_02-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_02-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_02-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"25","credit":"","camera":"NIKON D5000","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1474828716","copyright":"","focal_length":"24","iso":"160","shutter_speed":"3","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""}],"images_final":[{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_SPHINX_01.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_01-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_01-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_01-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_01-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_01-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""},{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_SPHINX_02.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_02-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_02-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_02-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_02-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_SPHINX_02-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"25","credit":"","camera":"NIKON D5000","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1474828716","copyright":"","focal_length":"24","iso":"160","shutter_speed":"3","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""}]}}}
