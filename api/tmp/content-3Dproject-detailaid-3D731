Climate change imperatives will call for the densification of these centers with residential supertowers, freeing-up vast tracks of suburbia for the creation of bioparks and urban farms.\u00a0With the reduction of traffic, people move about not out of need but out of desire. Traffic will gradually move underground and the city will return to the pedestrian, marking the end of the war between the city and the automobile.\u00a0Commuting in the City of the Future\u00a0will be a thing of the past. With increasing robotization, most jobs will become administrative or creative, and people will work from home or from neighborhood centers.","post_title":"<p>City of the Future, Washington DC, US 2008<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"city-of-the-future-washington-d-c-us-2008","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-05-16 16:47:28","post_modified_gmt":"2017-05-16 16:47:28","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/obra.neptuno.digital\/?post_type=projects&#038;p=731","menu_order":0,"post_type":"projects","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","ancestors":[],"page_template":"","post_category":[],"tags_input":[],"extended":{"year":"","images":[{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/03\/OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_01.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_01-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_01-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_01-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_01-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_01-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"11","credit":"","camera":"Canon EOS 30D","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1200927392","copyright":"","focal_length":"17","iso":"100","shutter_speed":"0.8","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""},{"image":{"width":2500,"height":1545,"file":"2017\/03\/OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_02.png","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_02-760x460.png","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_02-300x185.png","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_02-768x475.png","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_02-1500x927.png","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_02-1200x742.png","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/png"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""}],"images_final":[{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/03\/OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_01.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_01-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_01-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_01-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_01-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_01-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"11","credit":"","camera":"Canon EOS 30D","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1200927392","copyright":"","focal_length":"17","iso":"100","shutter_speed":"0.8","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""},{"image":{"width":2500,"height":1545,"file":"2017\/03\/OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_02.png","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_02-760x460.png","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_02-300x185.png","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_02-768x475.png","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_02-1500x927.png","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_CITY_FUTURE_02-1200x742.png","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/png"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""}]}}}
