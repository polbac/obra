This drawing can be changed and perfected by climbing on the stairs and adjusting the mirrors. Its form, defined by the straightness of the green laser light beam and the angle it forms at each mirror, can be contained but not fully controlled. The tower is an attempt to free drawing, free it from paper, canvas, and the interior of rooms, to take drawing outside and use it to bamboozle the eye with apparent complexity, then propel it up to the sky to a faint demise of atmospheric dissolution. The Beijing Line Tower's ancestry\u2014the photographs of shadows by Alexander Rodchenko, the luminous theatrical costumes of Oskar Schlemmer, Sol Le Witt's wall drawings, Fred Sandback's string drawings, Lebbeus Woods' installations\u2014can be traced down the annals of a fascination for freedom, freedom of the line from its paper support that is.

The project will define a certain rhythm of experience related to the time needed to negotiate arrays of overlapping trajectories which will be made subliminally legible through an insistence on certain thresholds sequences, some axial and some diagonal. The depth of the resulting layered space is sometimes revealed in the enfilades of doors that cut deep into the structure here and there as a perspectival projection of potential trajectories open to the visitors. Relying on the utmost geometric simplicity and the architectural resources that, as described above, can be easily missed or dismissed, the architectural design will recede perceptually to give primacy of place to the exhibited content, while at the same time trying to sustain it with a measure of discrete order. The structure, conceived as a repetitive grouping of small galleries, mostly 3 meters wide by 6 meters long, aims to create the atmosphere of repetitive neutrality necessary to contain all the unpredictable collision of richness the curatorial project proposes. The result is an undifferentiated labyrinth, one in which no proposed sequence of experience is particularly privileged and in which each visitor can trace his or her own personal trajectory.

In view of this epochal urgency, the project proposes to adopt healthier models of life in the interests of safeguarding the planet. Our proposal imagines the largest public park, the largest that the site can accommodate. With landscaping designed by Vogt London, it features a large amount of local and exotic trees. The crescent shaped six-story housing curve follows the trajectory of the sun framing the park to the southeast. It expands the garden of the Flaminia School and gives residents deep green views like from a New York condo on Fifth Avenue or Central Park West. The crescent roof is designed to be both a rainwater collector and a modern aqueduct. Rainwater is released into a tub, a fountain around which the volumes of the <em>City of Science<\/em> are arranged.","post_title":"<p>Citt&agrave; della Scienza, Rome, IT 2015<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"citt-della-scienza-masterplan-rome-it-2015","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-05-16 16:08:33","post_modified_gmt":"2017-05-16 16:08:33","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/obra.neptuno.digital\/?post_type=projects&#038;p=1237","menu_order":0,"post_type":"projects","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":731,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-03-30 22:00:22","post_date_gmt":"2017-03-30 22:00:22","post_content":"The city of the future will be polycentric, articulating into numerous distinctive neighborhoods of walkable size.

The anonymity we imagine\u00a0here is predicated upon regular rhythms, a stubborn\u00a0insistence on repetitive and simple forms, and on the\u00a0serene boredom produced by relentlessly recurring\u00a0dimensions. Today for the most part, architectural\u00a0form is put to the sorry task of buttressing a world\u00a0epidemic of egocentric individualism. We don\u2019t\u00a0know why that is. Maybe it is just the logical form\u00a0taken by the advanced stages of the social and\u00a0economic system we live under.

Besides the main nave with centralized altar, the church includes the vestry, a baptistery and an elevated choir accessible by stepped ramp. Another building on the site, the <em>Small Church<\/em> is modest in size with platonic proportions, a perfect cube of 16 meters.

The resultant action-at-a-distance bends the median spaces of the house, concealing the ends of rooms, washing walls in progressions of chiaroscuro and promoting a kind of dynamism-in-repose founded in the experience of the angular inertia felt when in between curving walls.
