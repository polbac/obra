The obscuring of obvious truths to create new, fake and more convenient ones is the preferred way information is distorted and knowledge falsified. The destruction of the environment and the darkening of the future are merely the ugly ways in which the truth reveals itself notwithstanding the well endowed efforts to conceal it. The\u00a0pavilion is a ten-meter cube constructed with a wood-stud structure and finished in plywood sheets. Inside, a fragment of a sphere is built by smearing plaster on a curved metal-lath surface. The spherical wall creates a concave space where the planetarium will function and, on the opposite side, a convex space serves as entry vestibule. While in the brightly illuminated vestibule, visitors will feel slightly oppressed by the body of the convex wall and the intense lighting. The vestibule is a place of transit where one is compelled to either enter the planetarium or leave the pavilion altogether. Inside the sphere, artifice is put to the service of wholeness by covering the two flat walls that slice the curve with mirrored foil, thereby creating the illusion of a full celestial hemisphere. The constellations are carefully mapped on the dome as drilled holes on the plaster shell become stars.","post_title":"<p>Planetarium by Four Pavilion, Shenzen, CN 2015<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"planetarium-shenzen-cn-2015","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-05-30 21:34:52","post_modified_gmt":"2017-05-30 21:34:52","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/obra.neptuno.digital\/?post_type=projects&#038;p=1252","menu_order":0,"post_type":"projects","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","ancestors":[],"page_template":"","post_category":[],"tags_input":[],"extended":{"year":"","images":[{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_02.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_02-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_02-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_02-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_02-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_02-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""},{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_01.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_01-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_01-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_01-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_01-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_01-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""}],"images_final":[{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_02.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_02-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_02-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_02-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_02-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_02-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""},{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_01.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_01-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_01-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_01-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_01-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_PLANETARIUM_BY_FOUR_01-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""}]}}}
