It is as if in every project Obra would pose the architectural question: is there a metaphysical explanation for the way things are or is this explanation only psychological in character?\r\n\r\n<em>Logic<\/em> presents us with an Obra determined to channel the divided condition of the architecture of the city through each and every project. This invariable of Obra\u2019s work, the constant presence of an implicit city, inhabits the typological mutations that propel forward Obra\u2019s architecture. It is as if on the face of a spectacle of the city dissolving into procedural regulations and an administrative \u201ccommon\" sense in the name of behavioral understanding of culture, Obra\u2019s work would quietly propose the experiment of trying to consistently weave the world with the two basic strains of inhabited space: one born out of a craving for community and the other born out of a love for solitude\u2014the two poles across which spans architecture as the scene of our emotional longing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Obra Architects <\/em><em>Logic, Selected Pr<\/em><em>ojects 2003-2016\r\n<\/em><span style=\"color: #000000;\">416pp,\u00a024.1 x 18 x 4.3 cm, Hardcover cloth\r\n<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Copenhagen, Denmark: <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.b-arki.dk\/obra.html\">Arkitektur B<\/a>, 2016<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">9788792700162<\/span>\r\n\r\nDistributed by <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http:\/\/ideabooks.nl\/9788792700162-obra-architects-logic-selected-projects-2003-2016\">Idea Books<\/a>.
