Its construction is proposed as a series of more or less cubic pavilions that orbit around the site's center of gravity, engaging the periphery of the lot and the allowed maximum height, and trying to bracket as much space in between them as possible. Across this captured distance the volumes will activate the entire site by virtue of suction, parataxis and charged adjacency. The volumes so juxtaposed \"look\" at each other, charging space with a condition of influence-at-a-distance similar to electromagnetism, the human gaze, or to Ezra Pound's imagist ideogrammic method of poetic composition and translation, suggesting the possibility of conveying implied abstract meaning through the vehicle of the physical means which are the destiny of architecture and also the vehicle of its own poetic tension. The resultant action-at-a-distance bends the median spaces of the house, concealing the ends of rooms, washing walls in progressions of chiaroscuro and promoting a kind of dynamism-in-repose founded in the experience of the angular inertia felt when in between curving walls. Action at a distance is also experienced in light cascading down open flights of stairs through the library in the mezzanine between the 2nd and 3rd floors\u2014a proposed addition to the program\u2014or light ricocheting through space as it is reflected between the mirror surface of the swimming pool and the convex planes of the plaster ceilings and walls. The cubic pavilions in the periphery house the bedrooms, spaces to enjoy the freedom from rationality afforded by dream. The Study is a special case of such a space, one given to day-dreaming and contemplation, in contrast to the mediating spaces which are reserved for day use, during the time that the clarity of natural light can bring life to their curved surfaces.","post_title":"<p>Villa of Captured Distance, Ordos, CN
