The client, an executive for a major cultural institution in the city, is herself a dedicated agent in the maintenance of a system of order devoted to the daily tasks of separating objects, storing and using them. It was during a survey of existing field conditions that the client was inadvertently unmasked as a meticulous moth hunter after specimens were found scotch-taped to a sheet of paper in recorded order of their capture. A flexible separation between night and day spaces as the client\u2019s basic programmatic requirement, in addition to her secret war on Lepidopters\u2014an order of insects largely divided between subfamilies with either diurnal or nocturnal habits\u2014inspired a direction for the project.","post_title":"<p>Loft on 4th Avenue, New York, US
