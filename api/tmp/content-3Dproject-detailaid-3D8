The building proposes to young minds an arrangement in triads that might be both familiar and easy to remember. There are three wings in the building with three classrooms in each wing. Each of the three wings also has three floors; there are also three stairs in the interior, etc. This arrangement into triads matches many things, not only the basic logical structures into which all.\r\n\r\nUs are born: left\/right\/middle; yes\/no\/maybe; space\/time\/objects; and so on, but also the triad mother\/father\/child common in a country where, until very recently, the policy of one child per family has been the law of the land.\r\n\r\nThe rigorously fenestrated concrete structure clad in local brick is configured as a faceted arc that, leaning against the north edge of the site, embraces a play-ground surrounded by a garden of local Chouchun trees (Ailanthus altissima) and of Peking Cotoneaster bushes (Cotoneaster acutifolius). The large playground, flanked to the north by the kindergarten and to the south by the garden is the soul and focus of the whole architectural arrangement. The building\u2019s facade is articulated with extreme simplicity by windows of the same size. This homogeneity creates a background against which sequences of stair-connected terraces are inserted into the fa\u00e7ade of the building, disrupting their order with spaces for outdoor learning and paths of direct connection between classroom and playground.","post_title":"Casa Osa, Osa Peninsula, CR","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"casa-osa-osa-peninsula-cr","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2016-12-20 02:01:39","post_modified_gmt":"2016-12-20 02:01:39","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/obra.neptuno.digital\/?post_type=projects&#038;p=8","menu_order":6,"post_type":"projects","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","ancestors":[],"post_category":[],"tags_input":[],"extended":{"year":"Current","images":[{"image":{"width":1080,"height":756,"file":"2016\/12\/master_plan-01.png","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"master_plan-01-150x150.png","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"medium":{"file":"master_plan-01-300x210.png","width":300,"height":210,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"medium_large":{"file":"master_plan-01-768x538.png","width":768,"height":538,"mime-type":"image\/png"},"large":{"file":"master_plan-01-1024x717.png","width":1024,"height":717,"mime-type":"image\/png"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"1"},{"image":{"width":862,"height":1008,"file":"2016\/11\/8.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"8-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"8-257x300.jpg","width":257,"height":300,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"8-768x898.jpg","width":768,"height":898,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0"}]}}}
