In this rarified urban world, nature occupies a realm of accommodating compromise to profit while coexisting in conditions of extreme physical congestion and cultural excitement. Thus, the concept for the <em>Korean Cultural Center<\/em> chases multiple sources of natural light, a mixture of direct and indirect, to create more comfortable environments. The design of the north-south section of the building pursues this, opening up exterior walls to incoming light from both south and north at more important public spaces in the building. These glazed facades are designed as geometricized <em>Light Clouds<\/em>. Their 3-dimensionality alludes to light as (necessary) object since their faceted geometry amplifies light by diffraction of beams simultaneously reflected by other facets. Constructed out of acid-etched glass structured with steel elements, these clouds of light will give unique character to the spaces of the <em>Korean Cultural Center<\/em>. In the complex patterning of their luminous volumes, the light clouds, as if momentarily delayed in the walls of the building, reference aspects of Korean culture like the bronze temple bell, the traditional wrapping cloth, and the Korean window screen.","post_title":"<p>Korean Culture Center, New York, US 2009<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"korean-culture-center-new-york-us-2009","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-05-17 21:06:40","post_modified_gmt":"2017-05-17 21:06:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/obra.neptuno.digital\/?post_type=projects&#038;p=968","menu_order":0,"post_type":"projects","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","ancestors":[],"page_template":"","post_category":[],"tags_input":[],"extended":{"year":"","images":[{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_KCC_NYC_01.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_01-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_01-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_01-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_01-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_01-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""},{"image":{"width":1492,"height":923,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_KCC_NYC_02.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_02-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_02-300x186.jpg","width":300,"height":186,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_02-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_02-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"2.8","credit":"","camera":"NIKON D80","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1260954042","copyright":"","focal_length":"28","iso":"125","shutter_speed":"0.025","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""}],"images_final":[{"image":{"width":1500,"height":927,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_KCC_NYC_01.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_01-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_01-300x185.jpg","width":300,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_01-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"large":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_01-1500x927.jpg","width":1500,"height":927,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_01-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""},{"image":{"width":1492,"height":923,"file":"2017\/04\/OBRA_KCC_NYC_02.jpg","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_02-760x460.jpg","width":760,"height":460,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_02-300x186.jpg","width":300,"height":186,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"medium_large":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_02-768x475.jpg","width":768,"height":475,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"OBRA_KCC_NYC_02-1200x742.jpg","width":1200,"height":742,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"2.8","credit":"","camera":"NIKON D80","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1260954042","copyright":"","focal_length":"28","iso":"125","shutter_speed":"0.025","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"fullscreen":"0","crop_data":""}]}}}
